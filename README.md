# All-in-one-weather
## This is the official repository of the All-in-one-weather device developed for TUESFest by Alex Ognyanov currently 10th grade.
## It collects important data from the environment via sensors and sends it to a remote server which then makes it possible to easily view the data represented by graphs by everyone. 
The visualisation can be modified so that only certain people with access can view it.  
If there is no connection at the place the device is placed, it will write all the data to an SD card which then can be manually visualized.
