# All-in-one-weather
## This is the official repository of the All-in-one-weather device developed for TUESFest by Alex Ognyanov currently 10th grade.
### It collects important data from the environment via sensors and sends it to a remote server which then makes it possible to easily view the data represented by graphs by everyone and analyse it. 
> The visualisation can be modified so that only certain people with access can view it.  
> If there is no connection at the place the device is placed, all the data is written on an SD card which then can be manually visualized. 

### The server files can be found **[here](https://github.com/AlexOgn/All-in-one-weather-server "Server files")**
